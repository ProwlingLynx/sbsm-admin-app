The app is split into two main directories: The front facing app and the backend app. Both have their own dependencies to keep in mind.

## Set up
- You can npm install the front facing app and the backend app separately by navigating to the respective directories.
- You will need to have typescript installed globally for the backend to output the files in the build directory.
